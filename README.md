# Number-System-Converter
This Number System Converter is used to converts a number from any number system to any another.

Generally, almost all number system converter is able to convert a number in number systems between 2 (binary) and 36.
This limit is due to "lack of letters" in Latin alphabet. As known it has 26 letters (A-Z). Also we have 10 digits (0-9), therefore converters is limited of number systems up to 36. 

I decided to extend the range of converting, so created converter has possibility to convert a number in range between 2 (binary) and infinity.
For this I use '{' and '}' symbols.

For example, there is a decimal number - 37 (of course you know that number 37 has two place values - tens [30] and ones [7]). 
We want to find out what the number will be in number system with base 40. After dividing 37 by 40 we got integer quotient - 0 and remainder of the division - 37. 
The number is out of range between 2 and 36, so there are not enough letters in Latin alphabet to convert number "37" into respective letter. Therefore, the number "37" becomes the only inseparable number {37} in number system with base 40. 
So number 37 in decimal number system is {37} in number system with base 40.
